What is Responsive web design?
Responsive web design is an approach to web design that makes web pages render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes from minimum to maximum display size.

With competition being stronger and stronger, one needs a solid food website templates to help you stand out from the masses.

I have developed a Responsive Food Japan Website which is a template of a Food Business Website in which one can give orders for the Food, can join the Food Japan Company as delivery person and can become the member of the company.
